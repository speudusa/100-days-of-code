**Today's Progress**: reviewing class notes and book about MVC princilples.

**Pre-Build Space -->**  reviewing chapters on MVC, applying small changes as I read.  It's always best to keep poking at it, right?

**Post-Build Space: -->**  creating questions for tonight.  Trying to predict answers based on my review and identify specific areas of trouble to help make the best use of time tonight. updating my own comments and running program to identify where it catches.

### Day 14: Fri, Nov 13, 2020 (eep!)


**Today's Progress**: reverting back to viewbags at the moment.  

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** My code is a mess, so stepping back to something that worked and I understood.  Plan to revisit how to update to persistent data and start fresh (not almost a month later)

**Pre-Build Space -->**  it's a mess

**Post-Build Space: -->**  i'm great at building MVC elements for get request.  lol!  everyday we make progress.

### Day 13: Thrus, Nov 12, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Started my Udemy course on full stack web dev

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** while, I feel confident in my JS & HTML skills, CSS and Bootstrap are not areas I'm strong in yet.  

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Ready to learn.  In the green zone.

**Post-Build Space: -->**  Much more indepth explanation of the boilerplate, unicode, and meta data.  Glad I tuned in.

### Day 12: Wed, Nov 11, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Updating my Razor pages and working more with my ViewBag/ViewModel transitions.  

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** Write it down in PLAIN ENGLISH.  yes, yes.  How am I calling things?  How do they know what to do?  

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Was having problems calling my Models into the Razor pages.  Inheritence between MVC parts is still confusing.  I know what I want it to do and that is half the struggle.

**Post-Build Space: -->**  I found the break point for my POST request.  But my Razor pages are working (up until the break) and that wasn't the case yesterday.  So yay!  Lots of thoughts on ineritance and organizing this.

### Day 11: Tues, Nov 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Updating from Viewbag to ViewModels in .ASP Core MVC application.  

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** Things got very busy with the house.  The house repairs FINALLY got started, so I was down a work space and work time.  Good news, the basement is getting closer and closer to being done.  Hubs and I replumbed the downstairs basement.  And the kiddos had their fall break.  Busy busy busy.  But now my morining time to code has returned, so this is a good thing.  Back to the challenge.  Also, got my official letter that states I'm in the apprenticeship pool!  YAY!

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Returned to my Book project.  SOOOOOO  glad I left myself some good notes about where to go next.  Not super happy about the state I left my transition from Viewbag to ViewModel.  But this will be a good place to review and pick up from.  

**Post-Build Space: -->**  Have the HttpGet functions working with ViewModels.  Having trouble with the POST side of the functions.  It's been a while, need to revisit this in past lessons.

### Day 10: Thurs, Oct 15, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Step 1:  Complete final class survey [check]
Step 2: Creating Reader Option (DD to select who is reading which book)

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:**   This is the start of creating relationships between 2 tables.  

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Have my book table ready to go.  Need to create Reader (Model, Controller, and View)

**Post-Build Space: -->**
Okay, so I now have a Reader Controller, Model, ViewModel, and Views(Index,CreateReader)

Ran into issues with converting my Edit function to start using my dBContext

### Day 9: Tues, Oct 13, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Initalized persistent data storage

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:**  Remember to download nuget packages

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Want to create presisent data to create other tables using my book object and edit functions

**Post-Build Space: -->**  mySQL Db is connected to my initial table.  Time to start planning relationships and how I want to build new tables

### Day 8: Mon, Ocy 12, 2020


**Today's Progress**: created viewmodles to assist with validation

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** 

**Pre-Build Space -->**  

**Post-Build Space: -->**  i want to do this with my edit function...

**Link to work:**  https://github.com/speudusa/BearPawPages

**------------------------------------------------------**


### Day 7: Fri, Oct 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Created the Edit features

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:**  Using ViewBags right now.  

**Pre-Build Space -->**   Want to be able to edit entire book object, and update page numbers and notes

**Post-Build Space: -->**  
   - Created edit function to edit the entire book object.
   - Created "Bookmark featuer that ONLY updates the page number and notes

### Day 6: Thurs, Oct 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Delete functionallity

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:**  delete functionality 
updated data management.

**Pre-Build Space -->** need to add some ids to my objects, and create data management.  

created data folder which will be responsible for the data instead of the book controller.

**Post-Build Space: -->**  
it works.  
  * I can add a book, and the ids
  * each new book is stored in a dictionary in the data folder at the moment.  (eventually this will move to a database)
  * I can select books to delete 


I like where this is going so far.  Slowing down and starting over has really helped.  Also, as this is the second time around, my build has less bugs in it and I'm able to free-form more to fit the needs of my project.  (highfive!)

### Day 5: Wed, Oct 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Started a new project.  It's cleaner.    

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** I know what I want, but a clean space will help me build it.  I can use my last project to help me keep things straight.  

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Using my textbook and videos, I started at the VERY VERY beginning.  As in "In the beginning there was only a Home Controller..."   While this feels VERY underwhelming and takes a hit at the morale, I know that I need the space and blank slate to rebuild.

**Post-Build Space: -->**  Created *Books Controller* and the following Books *View:  /Add and /Index*
The **Index view** will list all books (it's basically a bookshelf)
    - initially I hard coded this to verify that it works
    - I then replaced it with an Add and NewBook method
          - **Add** = HttpGet and takes us to the Add View
          - **NewBook** = HttpPost and allows us to update the view after the for is filled out (in the Add view)
    - titles are posted via foreach loop
The **Add view** will allow us to add books
     - contains a form to collect titles at this time

### Day 4: Tues, Oct 6, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Simplify.  All I need right now, is a MVP.  User Account and CRUD features are all I need.  

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** KISS.  

**Pre-Build Space -->**  What can I use my home controller for?  Add methods, About method?  
Need an Add View, About view.

Where will editing/deleting happen?  On the About View.  Think about that.  

**Post-Build Space: -->**  
Decided to start over.

### Day 3: Mon, Oct 5, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Working on the AddBook feature 

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** Want to create book object and have it appear on the home view in a table

**Pre-Build Space -->**  KISS
    - create book object (check)
    - pull book object back onto home index view <--
    - have buttons work:  Add new book -> Book ViewModel  and then Actually add book button -> return to home index and appear on the home index table
          - SOOO close to having this.  

**Post-Build Space: -->**
    - Removed ReadingList Contrller to create Shelf items (Model, View, ViewModel - using Home as Controller)
    - Stuck with importing book data.
    - plans for tonight = pick up here

### Day 2: Oct 2, 2020


**Today's Progress**: Created new branch that has my notes

### Day 1:  Oct 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Building One Page More

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:**   

**Pre-Build Space -->** The Reading List (RL) can exist without the Book (B) objects.  RL is basically a shelf to display things, anything really, books, people, rotary phones, etc.  The shelf can exist without the book in this context.  The B can not exist without the shelf (they would be floating like fruit in a jello ring.  We need to bring jello rings back.)

Okay, so now that I better understand this relationship, I see how I need to incorporate the ORM and collections.  

**Post-Build Space -->**  So, don't get mad.  I added Users instead.  This made a lot of sense with the section of the book I was reading.  While I was trying to figure out how to build the Book/RL relationship, the set up in the book made the most sense here.  Parent can add child AND book, but can now assign book to specific child (I hope)

(having a hard time testing this right now since I didn't finish my inital task and that is full of errors preventing me from running it, BUT in spirit I think it is a good start)

### Day 0: Oct 1, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I did code, but I wanted to set my intention and create a space for me to work through my blocks.  This Project is my final project for LaunchCode's LiftOff.  It is the (first) and biggest thing I have ever build on my own.  I am trying to make space for it in my day to day life, and hope that creating a place to plan, ponder, and grow from will be more helpful than just a list of Ta-Da's!  For me.  

I added a place to drop things.  I added space to list my goal for the day and a place to list where I stopped.  But these spaces are also places that can hold more than just facts and figures, but the story behind it all, the place when connections are made.  So, if you want to read along, you are welcome to.  I will try to keep these updates short and to the point.  

I should make a parking lot...  but not here.  

**Thoughts/Notes/Braindump space:** 

**Pre-Build Space -->**  Rethink my process.  How do I best learn?  Stories, writing about it, making connections.

**Post-Build Space: -->**  So, here is my redesigned log.  My rekindled passion to make this project happen.
